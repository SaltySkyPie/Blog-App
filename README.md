## Things I didn't have time for

Unfortunately I could not complete all of the points since I didn't have a lot of time.

The things I compromised on were:
- proper testing both on FE and BE. I know it's really important, however since I chose to do Test-Later-Development instead of Test-Driven-Development to save time I've then realized I've written bunch of code that isn't tested, and to do that it would require a lot of time. Since I usually do TDD, I haven't realized it would end up like this.
- better docs. I've written some "how-to" in the readme files however I feel like that isn't enough. I found that Nest.js code is pretty self explanatory and didn't need much of docs, but that's not the case for React. 

## Things I enjoyed

In prior to this excercise I've only worked on frontend projects that use GraphQL. On this project I've learned how to create production ready Nest.js backends using TypeORM and GraphQL as well as authentication. I've learned a lot though out and enjoyed it too. I'm greatful for that.
